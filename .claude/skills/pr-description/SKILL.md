# PR Description Skill

Produce a PR description with these sections, in order:

## Summary

One sentence. What changes and why. No file lists, no implementation detail.

## Motivation

Two to four sentences. The problem this solves or the capability it adds.
Link to the issue or design doc if one exists.

## Changes

Bullet list grouped by area (e.g. "API", "Tests", "Docs"). One bullet per
logical change, not per file.

## Risk and rollback

Note any breaking changes, migrations required, or feature flags.
Mention how to revert if something breaks.

## Testing

How you verified the change. Commands run, environments tested.
